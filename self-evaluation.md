# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel moderately confident using it but I think with practice it will get easier. the second challenge i had kind of backwards for a while and was having difficulty passing but once I got it right the whole function got a lot more clear

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had a lot of productive struggle where I tried different ideas out but i also definitely had unproductive struggle where i was just frustrated. Iteration has always been a confusing aspect of coding for me but I just need to practice it more

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I definitely need to practice something like the second challenge more. I factored in extra practice time into my schedule so i won't have to alter my schedule at present moment

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't really have any questions I just need to practice more!
